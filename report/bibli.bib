    abstract = { Abstract While soft material actuators can undergo large deformations to execute very complex motions, what is critically lacking in soft material robotic systems is the ability to collect high-resolution shape information for sophisticated functions such as environmental mapping, collision detection, and full state feedback control. This work explores the potential of a nearly commercial fiber optic shape sensor (FOSS) and presents the first demonstrations of a monolithic, multicore FOSS integrated into the structure of a fiber-reinforced soft actuator. In this pilot study, we report an open loop sensorized soft actuator capable of submillimeter position feedback that can detect the soft actuator's shape, environmental shapes, collision locations, and material stiffness properties. }

    abstract = { Soft robots have applications in safe human–robot interactions, manipulation of fragile objects, and locomotion in challenging and unstructured environments. In this article, we present a computational method for augmenting soft robots with proprioceptive sensing capabilities. Our method automatically computes a minimal stretch-receptive sensor network to user-provided soft robotic designs, which is optimized to perform well under a set of user-specified deformation-force pairs. The sensorized robots are able to reconstruct their full deformation state, under interaction forces. We cast our sensor design as a subselection problem, selecting a minimal set of sensors from a large set of fabricable ones, which minimizes the error when sensing specified deformation-force pairs. Unique to our approach is the use of an analytical gradient of our reconstruction performance measure with respect to selection variables. We demonstrate our technique on a bending bar and gripper example, illustrating more complex designs with a simulated tentacle. }

A polyimide thin film layer integrates FBG sensors is embedded into a soft silicone model as the strain limited layer for pneumatic actuation. The relation between the Bragg wavelength shift (BWS) value and the bending curvature of the soft silicone model is measured through the FBG calibration process. The curvature values of the soft silicone model at four bending shapes are calculated based on the BWS values and the interpolation algorithm. The reconstruction of the 3D shapes of the soft silicone model at different bending status are realized using the curve fitting function, and the correctness is verified. The results show that the error between the calculated and actual values of the bending curvature is no more than 2.1%, the proposed FBG-based sensing approach is effective for the measurement of the bending shape of the soft silicone model, it has application prospect in the field of soft robotics.}

    abstract = { Abstract Real-world environments are complex, unstructured, and often fragile. Soft robotics offers a solution for robots to safely interact with the environment and human coworkers, but suffers from a host of challenges in sensing and control of continuously deformable bodies. To overcome these challenges, this article considers a modular soft robotic architecture that offers proprioceptive sensing of pressure-operated bending actuation modules. We present integrated custom magnetic curvature sensors embedded in the neutral axis of bidirectional bending actuators. We describe our recent advances in the design and fabrication of these modules to improve the reliability of proprioceptive curvature feedback over our prior work. In particular, we study the effect of dimensional parameters on improving the linearity of curvature measurements. In addition, we present a sliding-mode controller formulation that drives the binary solenoid valve states directly, giving the control system the ability to hold the actuator steady without continuous pressurization and depressurization. In comparison to other methods, this control approach does not rely on pulse width modulation and hence offers superior dynamic performance (i.e., faster response rates). Our experimental results indicate that the proposed soft robotic modules offer a large range of bending angles with monotonic and more linear embedded curvature measurements, and that the direct sliding-mode control system exhibits improved bandwidth and a notable reduction in binary valve actuation operations compared to our earlier iterative sliding-mode controller. }

  abstract={Creating soft robots with sophisticated, autonomous capabilities requires these systems to possess reliable, on-line proprioception of 3D configuration through integrated soft sensors. We present a framework for predicting a soft robot's 3D configuration via deep learning using feedback from a soft, proprioceptive sensor skin. Our framework introduces a kirigami-enabled strategy for rapidly sensorizing soft robots using off-the-shelf materials, a general kinematic description for soft robot geometry, and an investigation of neural network designs for predicting soft robot configuration. Even with hysteretic, non-monotonic feedback from the piezoresistive sensors, recurrent neural networks show potential for predicting our new kinematic parameters and, thus, the robot's configuration. One trained neural network closely predicts steady-state configuration during operation, though complete dynamic behavior is not fully captured. We validate our methods on a trunk-like arm with 12 discrete actuators and 12 proprioceptive sensors. As an essential advance in soft robotic perception, we anticipate our framework will open new avenues towards closed loop control in soft robotics.},

    abstract = { Continuum robotics has rapidly become a rich and diverse area of research, with many designs and applications demonstrated. Despite this diversity in form and purpose, there exists remarkable similarity in the fundamental simplified kinematic models that have been applied to continuum robots. However, this can easily be obscured, especially to a newcomer to the field, by the different applications, coordinate frame choices, and analytical formalisms employed. In this paper we review several modeling approaches in a common frame and notational convention, illustrating that for piecewise constant curvature, they produce identical results. This discussion elucidates what has been articulated in different ways by a number of researchers in the past several years, namely that constant-curvature kinematics can be considered as consisting of two separate submappings: one that is general and applies to all continuum robots, and another that is robot-specific. These mappings are then developed both for the single-section and for the multi-section case. Similarly, we discuss the decomposition of differential kinematics (the robot’s Jacobian) into robot-specific and robot-independent portions. The paper concludes with a perspective on several of the themes of current research that are shaping the future of continuum robotics. }

They are a useful, reconfigurable tool which can turn passive structures into active robots through surface-induced deformations. However, because of this flexibility, it is difficult to create empirical models for all possible configurations and host body materials that may be used with robotic fabrics. In this paper, we focus on the widely-applicable case of a continuum joint formed by wrapping a robotic fabric around a soft cylinder, and propose a model that is compatible with a variety of host body materials. The model is able take sensor data from the robotic fabric and then estimate both state and stiffness of the underlying structural material. We show the functionality of our model on three different materials: polyethelene foam, Dragonskin 10 Slow elastomer, and Smooth-Sil 935 elastomer. Simplified models that are able to provide both state and stiffness estimations are an important tool that can lead to advancements in control of soft robots.},  keywords={},  doi={10.1109/ROBOSOFT.2018.8405379},  ISSN={},  month={April},}

   abstract = {We introduce a curvature sensor composed of a thin, transparent elastomer film (polydimethylsiloxane, PDMS) embedded with a microchannel of conductive liquid (eutectic Gallium Indium, eGaIn) and a sensing element. Bending the sensor exerts pressure on the embedded microchannel via the sensing element. Deformation of the cross-section of the microchannel leads to a change in electrical resistance. We demonstrate the functionality of the sensor through testing on a finger joint. The film is wrapped around a finger with the sensing element positioned on top of the knuckle. Finger bending both stretches the elastomer and exerts pressure on the sensing element, leading to an enhanced change in the electrical resistance. Because the sensor is soft (elastic modulus E 1 MPa) and stretchable (>350%), it conforms to the host bending without interfering with the natural mechanics of motion. This sensor represents the first use of liquid-embedded elastomer electronics to monitor human or robotic motion.},

This is largely due to the intrinsic difficulties in designing controllers for systems with infinite dimensions. This work extends our previously proposed formulation for the dynamics of a soft robot from two to three dimensions. The formulation connects the soft robot's dynamic behavior to a rigid-bodied robot with parallel elastic actuation. The matching between the two systems is exact under the hypothesis of Piecewise Constant Curvature. Based on this connection, we introduce a control architecture with the aim of achieving accurate curvature and bending control. This controller accounts for the natural softness of the system moving in three dimensions, and for the dynamic forces acting on the system. The controller is validated in a realistic simulation, together with a kinematic inversion algorithm.

First, we analyze the main mathematical properties of this model in the case of lightweight and non lightweight soft robots. Then, we prove that using the constant term of curvature as control output produces a minimum phase system, in this way providing the theoretical support that existing curvature control techniques lack, and at the same time opening up to the use of advanced nonlinear control techniques.
