\section{Conclusion}    \label{sec:conclusion}

In this paper we show that IMUs -- inexpensive, available off-the-shelf, and easy-to-integrate -- can be used for proprioception of soft robot arms.
Using a rigid-body model generated from IMU data and spherical linear interpolation, we were able to estimate the position of the end-effector of a soft robot arm with a median error of less than 10\% of the arm's length.
% reaching the performance of a median error below 10\%. 
Future work could employ methods to improve the accuracy of IMU-based shape estimates.
Future work could also investigate ways to make IMUs easier to integrate into soft robots.
This could be done by mounting the IMUs on small custom PCBs, and by integrating an entire string of IMUs as a self-contained sensor.
% Eventually, this 1D model could even be extended to a 2D surface sensing, by mapping the target with IMUs along two dimensions instead of one. \Dan{elaborate a little further, or cut this part}.\Yves{is ok?}
