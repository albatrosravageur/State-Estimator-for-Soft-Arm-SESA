# This package is a soft arm estimator that uses IMUs
## Goal
This project aims at estimating the state of soft hyperredundant arms using Inertial Measurement Units (IMU) placed along the arm. This repo contains tools to calibrate and stream your IMUs, and to reconstruct the shape based on your custom parameters. A GUI makes the  modeling process more convenient.

## State estimation method
To estimate the state of the arm, we sense its orientation at each IMU emplacement by reading the corresponding IMU. Then, we model the arm as a series of rigid bodies. Between each IMUs, the arm is cut into a number of rigid bodies set by the used. Each rigid body is oriented using spherical linear interpolation.

The state estimation method is based on the IROS 2022 paper: "A Proprioceptive Method for Soft Robots Using Inertial Measurement Units", by Yves J. Martin, Daniel Bruder and Robert J. Wood. Is is stored at the root of this Git repo.
